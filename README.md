# Myanmar combat archive
This is a publicly-available archive of the ongoing civil war in Myanmar. Behind the download links are real people, places, and things, and most of it is NSWF. Some of it is NSFL. Be careful!
I am not able to verify any information. I trust my sources, but misleading or incorrect titles are frequent, and sometimes footage is edited in order to mislead.
